# RE:Flex Dance I/O v2 PCB Design 

This repository contains source documents and manufacturing files for the RE:Flex Dance Pad's I/O Board. It was created using [KiCAD 5.1.4](https://kicad-pcb.org/).

The I/O Boards purpose is to provide an interface between a computer (using USB 2.0) and 4 'panel boards' (using RJ45) to:
- Receive panel board pressure sensor data, organize the data and send it to computer programs
- Receive LED data from computer programs, organize and send it to panel boards to display on RGB LED array

## Getting your own

For details on having your own made, see the [PCB manufacturing page](https://reflex.dance/manufacture/pcbs).

## Firmware

For the board to function, you will need to install the I/O board firmware to it, which can be found on the [firmware installation page](https://reflex.dance/firmware-installation).
